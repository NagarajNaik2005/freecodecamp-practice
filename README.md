# Web Development Practice Repository

This repository is a **central place for my daily web development practice**.  
It contains small, focused exercises organized by technology and topic.

Each folder has its own README explaining:
- What is practiced
- How the files are structured
- What concepts are covered

This repository is meant for **learning, consistency, and progress tracking**.
